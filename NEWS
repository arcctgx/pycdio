- Add ISO 9660 library 
  * add example programs to extract a file from an ISO fileystem 
  * add regression tsets

- Changes to make building outside of source tree (e.g. "make
  distcheck") work

- Include SWIG-derived files. In theory you don't need SWIG installed
  any more (although you do need a C compiler and libcdio installed).

- Remove bug in is_device()

- Fixes for Solaris and cygwin builds (compilation/linking flags)

- Minor SWIG changes to be more precise.
