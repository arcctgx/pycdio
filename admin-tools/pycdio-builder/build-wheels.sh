# This script is the entry point of builder container. It expects package sources
# to be available in /package directory inside the container. This can be achieved
# with Docker bind mount, e.g.:
#
# docker run --rm -u 1000:100 -v "$(pwd):/package" arcctgx/pycdio-builder
#

# build wheels for all Python versions provided in the container:
